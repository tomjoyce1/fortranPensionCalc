A Fortran program that simulates Irish pension growth from a starting salary until retirement. It accounts for salary increases, age-based contribution rates, annual investment returns, and inflation. 
Each yearâ€™s values and the inflation-adjusted pension pot are printed, ending with the final total at retirement. Contributions are maxed per age.

Will add 'volatility', an option to simulate pension growth at different returns (currently placeholder is flat 6%/year)
